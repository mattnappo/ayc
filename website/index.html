        <h2>Net Neutrality is a crucial topic which affects our daily lives on the internet. This act has the power to let  without being charged for "faster internet". But what happens if this wasn't the case. What would happen if big companies could dictate to us about what you look at and how fast you could reach that site. The FCC plans to repeal the net neutrality act on December 14 in Congress. The initial concept we have for you today shows not only the importance of keeping net neutrality but also a real time simulation of how the internet would look like if this act would be repealed. This simulation was made using html and Google spreadsheets to give an accurate depiction of an internet browser. We then made the service of the browser really slow.</h2></center>
