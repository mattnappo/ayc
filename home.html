        <p>Net Neutrality is a crucial topic which affects our daily lives on the internet. This act states that no company or person can be charged more just for faster internet or preferencial treatment. But what happens if this wasn't the case. What would happen if big companies could dictate to what we look at and how fast we could browse the internet. The FCC plans to repeal the net neutrality act on December 14 in Congress. The initial concept we have for you today shows not only the importance of keeping net neutrality but also a real time simulation of how the internet would look like if this act would be repealed. This simulation was made using html and Google spreadsheets to give an accurate depiction of an internet browser. We then made the service of the browser really slow and redirects which will be evident in a few seconds.</p>
